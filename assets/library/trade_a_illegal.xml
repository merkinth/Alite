        <p>Most systems will penalize either buying or selling
        of illegal trade items, notably firearms, narcotics
        (especially Arcturan Megaweed) and slaves. Slaves are supplied in
        cryosuspension in transporter coffins, and often turn out to be
        old and sick specimens of vaguely humanoid life forms. Most
        systems take recriminatory action if you trade those items on
        their station.</p>
